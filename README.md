<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/vue.js-2.6.11-green"> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/three.js-133.1-orange">

## To Do

-   [x] Create a ThreeJS scene with VueJS
-   [x] Add a commercial 3D model
-   [x] Set it 3 clickable interaction points
-   [ ] Works on mobile
-   [x] Points open a Vue component pop up
-   [x] Must be able to turn around the model on one axis at least.

## Challenge & Feeling

First time with VueJS, really interested framework, my code is not as clean as I'd like, just need more practice to formate my brain :smile:

I was not be able to add the points with HTML as I wanted because I didn't find the way to change style element in the animate loop with VueJS. So, the points of interest are ThreeJS sphere mesh. It's not clickable on mobile because I set OrbitControls.

## Usage

```
yarn install
```

```
yarn serve
```
